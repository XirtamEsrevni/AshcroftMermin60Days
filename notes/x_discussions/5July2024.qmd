The [transcript](../../transcripts/Ch5-7_Discussion_5July2024.vtt) text was generated via [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and then passed to [OpenAI GPT4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) for summary. The following prompt was used:


*Please summarize the attached transcript. Pay close attention to topics discussed; do not include things that are not in the transcript. Break each topic up into summaries in bullet point fashion. Be detailed when necessary. Make corrections to miss spellings in transcription text about solid state physics. Make it easy for the reader to quickly skim and understand. Produce the output in raw markdown code.*
