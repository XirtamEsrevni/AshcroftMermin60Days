    "text": "A tweet inspired journey to digest all of the iconic Ashcroft & Mermin in 60 days. The goal is to read about 13 pages everyday, take notes1, and discuss. Lets go!\n1 These will be more of dictations rather than rephrasings. The intent is to capture the most important content.\n\n\nSeems like people like the book club idea! The first book will be solid state physics (ashcroft/mermin), I'll set up a space for next thursday to talk about chs. 1-4 (p. 1-84 in my edition). Like or DM if you want to join, I'll create a groupchat. https://t.co/QNrgHAsb6O\n\n— Max Aifer (@MaxAifer) June 7, 2024\n\n\n\nMax Aifer is also providing his Notion notes.",

    "text": "Thermal Conductivity of a Metal\nA one-dimensonal thermal current will be given by \\(j^q = -\\kappa \\frac{dT}{dx}\\). Simplifying this to view the thermal energy per electron before and after a collision, would be \\(\\mathcal{E}(T[x\\prime])\\) and \\(\\mathcal{E}(T[x])\\), respectively. Consider that two thermal resivoirs, a hot and cold, then we can write:\n\\[ j^q = \\frac{1}{2} n\\, v\\left( \\mathcal{E}(T[x-v\\tau]) - \\mathcal{E}(T[x+v\\tau])\\right) \\]\nthe first term in parenthesis is the hot and the second the cold. The prefactor is the number of electrons and their velocity. Expanding about the point \\(x\\) gives:\n\\[j^q = nv^2\\tau \\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dT}\\left(-\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)\\]\nIn 3D, assumping isotropic velocity distribution, \\(\\langle \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3}v^2\\), and from thermodynamics \\(n\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{dT}=C_v\\). Then the thermal current is given as:\n\\[\\mathbf{j}^q = -\\frac{1}{3}v^2\\tau C_v \\nabla T\\]\nand defining thermal conductivity as:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} v^2 \\tau C_v \\]\nOne of the success of this analysis is the Wiedemann-Franz law, which assumes both the electronic specific heat, \\(C_v\\), and the electronic velocity \\(v\\) are described through classical ideal gas laws and thus leads to:\n\\[\\frac{\\kappa}{\\sigma} = \\frac{3}{2} \\left(\\frac{k_B}{e}\\right)^2 T\\,,\\]\nWhich surprisingly agreed with experiments, because the electronic contributions to specific heat is no where near \\(\\frac{3}{2} n k_B\\). It turned out that the agreement was pure luck in canceling of two errors in the Drude theory approximation that cancel each other out.",
